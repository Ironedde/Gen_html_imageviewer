TODO:
*Decide if there should be one index file or one in each directorylevel
*Decide where to put the javascript
*Decide if there should be some ability to costuimize


GOAL:
*You should be able to navigate through the subdirectories and display images in
 one viewer


Later GOALS:
*There should be minitures of the images, though these will not be loaded
 all at once due to the amount that could be forced to load.
     *Therfore it should be possible to load some images at a time,
      and when scrolling down it should load more.

*Introduce passwordprotection? Maybe, maybe not.... it would by in php in
 that case....


Summary:
This project should only be something simple, nothing to fancy just a
way to index and view images (maybe files in the future) without using
the default html viewer =)
